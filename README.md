(Multi Variate Testing) interpreter for [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) code written in Golang

# What what ?
[PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) is a framework for providing randomised parameter assignment for controlling parameters and defaults used in code. It exists as a combination of both a generalised methodology and as a DSL for constructing online field experiments.

An excellent introduction can be found both in the original research, [Designing and Deploying Online Field Experiments (Bakshy, Eckles and Bernstein)](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3174v1.pdf), and in the following lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ayd4sqPH2DE.

# So what is this ?
This is an interpreter that provides the basic functionality for running [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) interpreter code, allowing for integrating experiments into GoLang applications.

There is also a compiler to turn PlanOut DSL into the code understood by the compiler.

Much of the additional tooling for [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) can be found the in original project.

# How to run a basic experiment ?
Here's an example program that consumes compiled [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) code and executes the associated experiment using the Golang interpreter.

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "github.com/biased-unit/planout-golang"
)

// Example input structure
type ExampleStruct struct {
    Member int
    String string
}

func main() {
    // Read PlanOut code from file on disk.
    data, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("test/simple_ops.json")

    // The PlanOut code is expected to use json.
    // This format is the same as the output of
    // the PlanOut compiler webapp
    // http://facebook.github.io/planout/demo/planout-compiler.html
    var js map[string]interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(data, &js)

    // Set the necessary input parameters required to run
    // the experiments. For instance, simple_ops.json expects
    // the value for 'userid' to be set.
    example := ExampleStruct{Member: 101, String: "test-string"}
    params := make(map[string]interface{})
    params["experiment_salt"] = "expt"
    params["userid"] = generateString()
    params["struct"] = example

    // Construct an instance of the Interpreter object.
    // Initialize Salt and set Inputs to params.
    expt := &planout.Interpreter{
        Salt:       "global_salt",
        Evaluated:  false,
        Inputs:     params,
        Outputs:    map[string]interface{}{},
        Overrides:  map[string]interface{}{},
        Code:       js,
    }

    // Call the Run() method on the Interpreter instance.
    // The output of the run will contain the dictionary
    // of variables and associated values that were evaluated
    // as part of the experiment.
    output, ok := expt.Run()
    if !ok {
        fmt.Println("Failed to run the experiment")
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("Params: %v\n", params)
    }

    fmt.Println(output)
}
```

Suppose we want to run the following experiment:
```go
id = uniformChoice(choices=[1, 2, 3, 4], unit=userid);
```

The [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) code generated by the compiler looks like:

```json
{
  "op": "seq",
  "seq": [
    {
      "op": "set",
      "var": "id",
      "value": {
        "choices": {
          "op": "array",
          "values": [
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4
          ]
        },
        "unit": {
          "op": "get",
          "var": "userid"
        },
        "op": "uniformChoice"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each execution of the above experiment will result in setting the variable 'id'. The output to stdout will look like:

```go
Params: map[experiment_salt:expt userid:noocavzddw salt:id id:2]
Params: map[experiment_salt:expt userid:cuncjyqmmz salt:id id:1]
```

# How to run a experiments in an allocated namespace ?
This example consumes multiple compiled [PlanOut](http://github.com/facebook/planout) experiments and executes within a namespace.

```go
package main

func main() {
    js1 := readTest("test/simple_ops.json")
    js2 := readTest("test/random_ops.json")
    js3 := readTest("test/simple.json")

    inputs := make(map[string]interface{})
    inputs["userid"] = "test-id"

    n := planout.NewSimpleNamespace("simple_namespace", 100, "userid", inputs)
    n.AddExperiment("simple ops", js1, 10)
    n.AddExperiment("random ops", js2, 10)
    n.AddExperiment("simple", js3, 80)

    out, ok = := n.Run()
}

```

# The Compiler

This PlanOut compiler implementation was reverse engineered from the existing open-source JavaScript compiler. The
official [JavaScript compiler](http://planout-editor.herokuapp.com/) was generated with
the [Jison](http://zaa.ch/jison/) parser generator, based
on [this grammar file](https://github.com/facebook/planout/blob/master/compiler/planout.jison)

## Compiling and running a PlanOut script

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    planout "github.com/biased-unit/planout-golang"
)

func main() {
	script := `id = uniformChoice(choices=[1, 2, 3, 4], unit=userid)`

	code, err := planout.Compile(script)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	interpreter := planout.Interpreter{
		Name: "test",
		Salt: "test",
		Inputs: map[string]interface{}{
			"userid": 12345,
		},
		Outputs:    map[string]interface{}{},
		Overrides:  map[string]interface{}{},
		Code:         code,
	}

	outputs, ok := interpreter.Run()
	if !ok {
		log.Fatal("interpreter.Run() failed.")
	}

	fmt.Println(outputs)
}

```

## Compiler details

The `planout-golang` compiler was written from scratch instead of using a generator. This requires more lines of code but
gives better control over syntax and error messages. It also makes things like parsing JSON literals embedded in
PlanOut code much simpler and less error-prone. Several bugs in the official compiler were fixed in this implementation.
The bug fixes are mentioned in the list of incompatibilities.

Internal names of lexical tokens and syntax tree nodes are mostly consistent with those in the official grammar file,
except where it made sense to change them. For example, the official compiler uses `CONST` tokens for both string and
numeric literals, whereas this compiler has separate `STRING` and `NUMBER` tokens. This helps with simplifying the
parser.

### Incompatibilities with official compiler

The syntax of this compiler is almost identical to that of the official implementation. However, there are some key
differences that make the two compilers not 100% compatible.

Incompatibilities come in two types: forwards incompatibilities and backwards incompatibilities.

A forwards incompatibility means that a script which compiles using the `planout-golang` compiler won't
compile using the official compiler. 
A backwards incompatibility means that a script which compiles using the official compiler won't compile using the
`planout-golang` compiler.

##### Dots in identifiers

In the `planout-golang` compiler, identifiers may contain the character `.`, which is not allowed by the official compiler.

For example, the following is valid PlanOut using the `planout-golang` compiler:

```
button.color = uniformChoice(choices=["red", "blue"], unit=userid)
```

#### Whitespace

Whitespace is completely ignored by the `planout-golang` compiler, but is part of the official compiler's syntax in some
rare cases. For example, the following compiles using `planout-golang`, but fails using the official compiler:

```
x = 1+1;
```

Using the official compiler, a space is required after the `+` token:

```
x = 1+ 1;
```

This is only true for the `+` and `-` infix operators. For example `x=1*1;` is a valid PlanOut statement
according to the official compiler. It doesn't really make sense to treat whitespace inconsistently like this, so this
behavior was not replicated in `planout-golang`.

#### Comments

`planout-golang` supports in-line comments using the `#` symbol to indicate the start of a comment. Anything after and
including the `#` symbol in a line is ignored by the lexer. The official compiler does not support comments.

For example, the following is a valid PlanOut script according to the `planout-golang` compiler:

```
# This is an experiment that randomizes the number of lines to display under a headline in the search results page.

num_lines_to_display = uniformChoice(choices=[1,2,3], unit=userid) # sets the number of lines to display
```

#### Assignment statements in switch/case blocks

The official PlanOut compiler has switch/case statements but does not allow a case block to start with an assignment 
statement. Because of the way the grammar file was written, case blocks can only be `if`, `switch` or `return` statements.

For example, the following PlanOut script is valid using `planout-golang` but not using the official compiler:

```
switch {
    country == "US" => my_param = uniformChoice(choices=[0, 1], unit=client_id);
    country == "JP" => my_param = uniformChoice(choices=[2, 3], unit=client_id);
}
```

After the `=>` token, the official compiler only allows a `SWITCH`, `RETURN`, or `IF` token. If using the official
compiler, the following workaround can achieve the same result as the above exmaple:

```
switch {
    country == "US" => if (true) { my_param = uniformChoice(choices=[0, 1], unit=client_id); };
    country == "JP" => if (true) { my_param = uniformChoice(choices=[2, 3], unit=client_id); };
}
```

#### JSON literals

The official compiler allows for so-called JSON literals by prefixing with an `@` token. These JSON literals can only contain
literal arrays, maps, strings and numbers (i.e. no identifiers or other expressions)
They can also be indexed like a normal map or array. This is a nice way to allow for JSON-valued parameters but also a
lightweight implementation of a hash map.

For example:

```
my_param = @{"a": 1, "b": [2, 3, "four"]}
my_other_param = my_param["b"]
```

Is valid PlanOut that compiles with both the official compiler and `planout-golang`.

However, the actual implementation of JSON literals in the official compiler is far more permissive than the JSON
standard and is quite buggy. It allows for all kinds of nonsense such as:

```
my_param = @{{"a": 1}: "b"}
```

One might think it's useful to have an object-keyed object. But this code compiles to:

```json
{
  "op": "seq",
  "seq": [
    {
      "op": "set",
      "var": "my_param",
      "value": {
        "op": "literal",
        "value": {
          "[object Object]": "b"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

So the information in the key has been lost and replaced with the string "[object Object]". This kind of thing should
not be allowed to happen.

Slightly less egregiously, the official compiler allows for single-quoted strings in JSON literals.

The `planout-golang` compiler only allows for actual JSON in a JSON literal. Internally, it relies on Go's `encoding/json`
package to determine what is or is not valid JSON. So the `@` token can be followed by a JSON object, array, string,
boolean, number, or null. This means that strings inside JSON literals use double quotes only, and JSON literal objects
must use strings for keys.
